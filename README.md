# Mapping HPE Representations

## Task formulation
Given Dataset D1, D2, ..., Dn and representations R1, R2, ..., Rn, find if mapping exists between representations (i,j) <- (1..n) Ri <-> Rj. Or find good enough representations for each Di so that we can create one whole dataset with all the representations for each image.
